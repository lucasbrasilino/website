Hi, nice to meet you. Iâ€™m Lucas Brasilino.

Iâ€™ve been envolved with system administration, network administration and freesoftware/opensource technologies since 1995. So many solutions and implementations Iâ€™ve done in these 19 years, but Iâ€™ve never had a blog ðŸ™‚ Now I came back to academia to do a Masters in network field, focusing on Software Defined Network and Network Virtualization.

Now I have some new interests, like Software Defined Network, OpenFlow, Mininet, Network Virtualization, Cloud Computing, FPGA, NetFPGA etc.. etc.. etc. Thatâ€™s why I created this blog. Enjoy!
